# Licence

Every repository needs a licence.

## Introduction

1. For a gentle introduction to software licenses see [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/).

2. Or if you want to see a completed example then browse to [github.com/canonical/desktop-engineering/LICENSE.md](https://github.com/canonical/desktop-engineering/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

## Instructions

1. Choose a license:

   - GPL-3 for project (no +)
   - LGPL-3 for libraries (no +)
   - AGPL for online services (no +)
